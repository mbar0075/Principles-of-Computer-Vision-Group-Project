## Description of Task:
This task explored a variety of data augmentation techniques in computer vision, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. The main objectives of the task were to investigate the concept of data augmentation in computer vision, conduct a thorough review of the existing literature on the topic, implement selected techniques using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, as well as develop custom implementations from scratch using OpenCV. Additionally, the task involved generating augmented images using the chosen techniques and evaluating their performance in comparison to other approaches and the original images. By accomplishing these objectives, this task aimed to contribute valuable insights into the field of data augmentation techniques in computer vision, showcasing their potential and effectiveness.

## Deliverables:
